## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I am going to build a medication helper. The idea came to me from watching my mom flip between papers, with a bunch of scattered handwriting, pills scattered in front of her. She recently came home from a month long trip to California, and brought my grandma with her. She now has the task of filling my grandmother's pill boxes with the multiple medications and vitamins she is on. She was getting confused jumbling between papers with times and directions and pills. A centralized location for all of the information would help her keep everything in order, as well as make her life much less stressful.
